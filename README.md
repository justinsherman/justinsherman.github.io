## Featured Work

Ethical Tech recently became one of the first organizations in the country to train active judges on the machine learning processes and algorithmic bias behind so-called risk assessment algorithms (RAAs), prejudiced recidivism predictors used in state courts across the country to recommend bail amounts and prison sentences to judges. RAAs are amplifying existing inequalities under the veil of digital objectivity. Read more about our [Algorithms and Justice Project](https://ethical-tech.org/projects/). Also check out our project to create the first open source "Ethical Tech 101" college class curriculum [here](https://ethical-tech.org/request-for-collaboration/).

In√©s Jordan-Zoob and I wrote an essay for _SIGNAL_ Magazine, "[Hands-Off Weaponry Requires Hands-On Planning](https://afcea.org/content/hands-weaponry-requires-hands-planning)," which was nominated for their best contributed article of the year. We discuss the ethics of semi-autonomous and fully autonomous weaponry in the global context.

Robert Morgus and I created the first robust framework for liberal-democratic policymakers to understand the global Internet. The full paper, "[The Idealized Internet vs. Internet Realities (Version 1.0)](https://s3.amazonaws.com/newamericadotorg/documents/The_Idealized_Internet_vs._Internet_Realities_Version_1.0_2018-07-25_203930.pdf)," lays out our framework, analyzes competing international visions of the global Internet, and discusses the shortfalls and tensions in those visions. See our corresponding op-ed for [_New America Weekly_](https://www.newamerica.org/weekly/edition-213/tale-two-internets/) and [_Pacific Standard_](https://psmag.com/news/protecting-an-open-internet).

Deb Crawford and I created the first comprehensive assessment of all U.S. federal IoT security and privacy policies. Read the paper in [_Journal of Cyber Policy_](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/23738871.2018.1514061). Also see our feature in [_POLITICO_](https://www.politico.com/newsletters/morning-cybersecurity/2018/09/04/whats-next-for-data-breach-legislation-329005) and my attached op-eds for [_Defense One_](https://www.defenseone.com/ideas/2018/08/internet-things-national-security-problem/150301/?oref=d-river) and [_The State of Security_](https://www.tripwire.com/state-of-security/government/u-s-federal-iot-policy/). Our two policy recommendations, made earlier this year, ended up in the new [US National Cyber Strategy](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/National-Cyber-Strategy.pdf)!
